# CIHM-Normalise
Canadiana specific string normalisation functions

Currently iso8601() is only used as part of https://github.com/crkn-rcdr/CIHM-METS-parse , reading from a "CMR" pubdate field and attempting to set a 'min' and a 'max' attribute that is then used by Solr in searches.

The "CMR" intermediary XML is generated by XSLT using files under https://github.com/crkn-rcdr/CIHM-METS-parse/tree/master/lib/CIHM/METS/resource/xsl , which is what parses the issueinfo, MarcXML and SimpleDC.
